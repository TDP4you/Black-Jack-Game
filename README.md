# Black Jack Game (Python)

Second Project that I have implemented during my online course while learning python. 
The rules of the game are as follows:
1. Player have the option to choose from Stand, Hit and Double./
  a. Hit: Take another card from the dealer.
  b. Stand: Take no more cards, also known as "stand pat", "stick", or "stay".
  c.Double down: The player is allowed to increase the initial bet by up to 100% in exchange for committing to stand after receiving       									exactly one more card.
2. Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21.
3. Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.
4. Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), without a dealer blackjack.
